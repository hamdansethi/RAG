# üìö Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

## üîÅ General Steps in RAG

1. **Query Input**  
   The user submits a natural language query.

2. **Document Retrieval**  
   Relevant documents are fetched from a knowledge base using either keyword-based (e.g., BM25) or embedding-based (e.g., FAISS) search.

3. **Context Preparation**  
   Retrieved documents are concatenated or selected to be used as input context for the language model.

4. **Response Generation**  
   A generative model (e.g., GPT, T5) uses the query and retrieved context to generate a response.

5. **(Optional) Re-ranking / Feedback Loop**  
   Results may be refined with re-ranking or iterative steps to improve relevance and accuracy.

## üÜö Naive RAG vs Advanced RAG

| Feature                         | Naive RAG                                                              | Advanced RAG                                                                 |
|----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Retrieval Method**            | Simple (e.g., BM25, TF-IDF)                                            | Semantic search using vector embeddings (e.g., FAISS, ANN)                  |
| **Query-Document Matching**     | Keyword-based                                                          | Meaning-based (semantic similarity)                                         |
| **Document Re-ranking**         | Typically not used                                                     | Frequently includes learned or heuristic re-ranking                         |
| **Generation Strategy**         | Basic prompt-based generation                                          | Fine-tuned models with cross-attention on retrieved docs                    |
| **Multi-hop Reasoning**         | Not supported                                                          | Supported via iterative retrieval and reasoning                             |
| **Training/Fine-tuning**        | Uses pre-trained models only                                           | Fine-tuned on domain-specific or task-specific data                         |
| **Use Cases**                   | Simple chatbots, basic Q&A                                             | Legal/medical assistants, agents, complex QA systems                        |
| **Performance**                 | Lower relevance and coherence                                          | Higher accuracy, factuality, and contextual depth                          |

## ‚úÖ Summary

- **Naive RAG** is easy to implement but limited in performance due to simple retrieval and no optimization.
- **Advanced RAG** leverages powerful techniques like semantic search, re-ranking, and fine-tuned generation to improve accuracy and understanding.
